A work-in-progress fork of `phonegap-plugin-local-notification` which allows for scheduling of notifications. It is loosely based on the [W3C Notifications Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/), but adds scheduling of notifications. It also adds some permission-handling functions which are not part of the spec.

## Usage

To add to your project:

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/Menardi/phonegap-plugin-local-notification
```

### Notification(title, options)

Create a notification by passing in the title (String), and an optional options object.

```
var notification = new Notification('My Notification', {});
```

#### The options object

The options object is used to customise your notification.

```
{
    tag: '',
    body: '',
    icon: '',
    timestamp: 0,
    sound: '',
    url: '',
    channel: {
        id: 'default',
        name: 'Default',
        description: ''
    }
}
```

##### options.tag (String)

The tag is an ID which can be used to reference the notification. For example, after scheduling a notification, you can cancel it by calling `Notification.cancel(tag)`. You should always set a tag, or else you will not be able to reference it later.

##### options.body (String)

The main body of the notification. For example, for a messaging app, this would normally be the contents of the message, whereas the sender would be the title.

##### options.icon (String) [Android only]

On Android, this is the icon that shows in the notification bar (the `smallIcon`). It **must** be in your `res/drawable` folders, and cannot be from anywhere else. On Android, the icon should be referenced without its extension, and with `res://` in front to show that it is in your res folder. For example, if you have an icon called `mynotification.png`, then this option should be `icon: 'res://mynotification`.

On iOS, the system automatically uses your app's icon, and this cannot be changed.

##### options.timestamp (Number or Date)

In the W3C spec, this is supposed to be used to show the time the notification refers to (such as an upcoming event). However, in this plugin, it is used to schedule the notification. The time can be either a unix-style timestamp, or a Date object.

```
time: Date.now() + 60000 // in one minute
time: new Date('2020-01-01T08:00:00') // 8am on 1/1/2020
```

##### options.sound (String) [Not in spec]

The sound to play when the notification is shown. Note that the only format supported by both Android and iOS is `.wav`.

On Android, this must be in your `res/raw` folder, and referenced similarly to the icon above -- `mynotification.wav` would be `sound: 'res://mynotification`. If not specified, the system default sound will be used.

On iOS, this can be loaded directly from your `www` folder. Prefix the path with `file://`. So, if your audio file is located in `www/audio/notification.wav`, set `sound: 'file://audio/notification.wav'`.

##### options.url (String) [Not in spec]

If specified, tapping the notification will open this URL rather than opening the app. Ensure that it is prepended with the protocol (`http://` or `https://`).

##### options.channel (Object) [Not in spec] [Android only]
For all Android apps targeting 8.0 and above (which is essentially all apps now), notifications must specify a _channel_ on which to send the notification. The idea is to give users more fine-grained control over notifications. Each channel should correspond to a type of notification. The user can then disable notifications from the Android settings menu based on these channels. To learn more, [read this blog post](https://medium.com/exploring-android/exploring-android-o-notification-channels-94cd274f604c).

By default, this plugin creates a channel called "Default". You do not need to create any other channels if you do not want to. For most cases, this default channel will suffice.

> Once a channel has been created, it cannot be changed. For example, the sound can never be changed again for this channel. Additionally, a created channel can not be removed from your app's settings menu. Note that this plugin only creates channels when the notification is _shown_, not when it is first scheduled.

For example, a todo app may have various notifications, such as reminders and overdue notifications. If the user does not want to get overdue notifications, they can then disable these individually from the app's settings menu, rather than disabling all notifications.

```
// Reminder
channel: {
    id: 'reminders',
    name: 'Reminders'
    description: 'Get reminded when something needs to be done'
}

// Overdue
channel: {
    id: 'overdue',
    name: 'Overdue',
    // no description -- it is optional
}
```

### Notification.close({ tag: String })

Close a notification. If it is already shown, it will be dismissed. If it is scheduled for the future, it will be unscheduled. Pass in the tag that was used to originally schedule it.

```
var notification = Notification('Close this', { tag: 'n1' });
Notification.close('n1');
```

### Notification.requestPermission(callback)

Request the user to enable the notifications permission. This will bring up the permissions dialog if necessary. The callback will return the result as a string, either `granted` or `denied`.

```
Notification.requestPermission(function(status) {
    if(status === 'granted') {
        // Ready to use notifications
    } else {
        // Permission was denied
    }
});
```

### Notification.hasPermission(callback) [Not in spec]

Check if the user has allowed notifications for this app. The callback will be passed one argument, `true` is granted and `false` otherwise.

```
Notification.hasPermission(function(status) {
    if(status === 'granted') {
        // Ready to use notifications
    } else {
        // Permission was denied
    }
});
```

### Notification.openPermissionScreen() [Not in spec]

Open the screen where the user can manually grant notification permission.

## Handling events

The spec describes several event callbacks, such as `onclick`, but they are not implemented in this plugin. This is because these callbacks assume you always have a reference to the notification, which is not always the case if you are scheduling notifications for the future. Instead, a global `notificationclick` event is fired, with the `tag` included so you can determine which notification it refers to.

```
document.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(ev) {
    console.log('Notification clicked: ' + ev.detail.tag);
});
```
